Workshop code: **682BWX**

Use Orisa's Halt ability to pull enemies into the Ilios well. Players spawn with temporary invulnerability, indicated by an aura effect. Players must be within the white area to use Halt. Players that leave the white area and re-enter will have to wait for a short cooldown before being able to use Halt again. Players that leave the red area will be thrown in the well.
